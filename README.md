# Coffee Sales Dashboard

This project involves analyzing sales data using Excel, from data gathering and cleaning to creating a dynamic dashboard that provides insights into sales trends. The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter data by different categories.

## Project Overview

The Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard project showcases the following key features:

- **Data Gathering**: Using formulas like `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX`, and `MATCH` to collect customer and product data, and calculate sales using multiplication formulas.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implementing multiple `IF` functions, date, and number formatting, checking for duplicates, and converting data ranges into tables for better analysis.
- **Data Preparation**: Creating pivot tables to summarize and organize the data for visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Building a dashboard with various charts and interactive filters.

## Key Steps

### A. Data Gathering
1. **Customer Data**: Gathered using `VLOOKUP`.
2. **Product Data**: Retrieved using `INDEX` and `MATCH`.
3. **Sales Calculation**: Performed using multiplication formulas.

### B. Data Cleaning
1. **Logical Tests**: Applied multiple `IF` functions for data validation.
2. **Date and Number Formatting**: Ensured consistency in data presentation.
3. **Duplicate Check**: Identified and removed duplicate entries.
4. **Table Conversion**: Converted ranges to tables for easier data handling.

### C. Data Preparation
1. **Pivot Tables**: Used pivot tables to structure data for visualization.

### D. Data Visualization
1. **Plot Chart**: Created and formatted a plot chart to visualize sales data.
2. **Timeline**: Inserted a timeline to filter data by date range.
3. **Slicers**: Added slicers to filter data by roast type, size, and loyalty card.
4. **Bar Charts**: Built bar charts for sales by country and top customers.
5. **Dashboard Assembly**: Combined all visual elements into a single dashboard.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes:

- **Line Plot**: Displays total sales of coffee over time.
- **Bar Charts**: Visualizes sales by country and the top 5 customers by sales.
- **Filters**: Allows data filtering by roast type, coffee size, loyalty card, and timeline filter.

## How to Use

1. **Data Input**: Add your sales data to the source table.
2. **Refresh Data**: Ensure pivot tables and charts are updated with the new data.
3. **Interact with the Dashboard**: Use slicers and the timeline to filter and analyze the data.

## Final Touches

- Hiding gridlines and headers for a cleaner appearance.
- Customizing slicer styles and timeline appearance to match the dashboard's theme.
- Ensuring dynamic filtering by connecting slicers and timelines to all charts.
